#we have only two layers in this application


1. #upload file
upload document 
store the document in the upload folder




#Inngestion layer - Data Ingestion = file upload route

extract text from the document
chunk the text 
turn the text into vector 
store the text

#The Q&A Request layer 
question reformulation
retrieval
augmentation
generation
streaming

 Production Architecture
Async Everything: Always use async def for your routes to handle multiple concurrent AI requests without blocking.
Background Tasks: Use FastAPI BackgroundTasks for small post-response jobs like logging or updating analytics.
Distributed Task Queues: For heavy workloads like re-indexing thousands of documents, use Celery with Redis to offload work from your main API server.
Stateful Memory: Store conversation history in a database like PostgreSQL to maintain multi-turn context across different API calls.
